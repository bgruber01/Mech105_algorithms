# Mech105_algorithms
The Mech 105 Algorithms repository contains assignments from my spring 2022 Mech 105 class. The goal of these assignments are to construct algorithms that can compute certain topics we were currently studying in the class. In this class the 4 main sections we learned about included 
* Root Finding (An algorithm designed to compute the zeros/roots of a continuous function)
* LU Decomposition (More efficient way to implement gauss elimination to solve systems of equations)
* Simpsons 1/3 Rule (Efficiently find the value of a definite integral)
* Linear Regression (A predictive analysis that predicts the value of a variable based on the value of another variable)
