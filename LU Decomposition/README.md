# LU Decomposition
LU Decomposition algorithm is the factorization of a given square matrix into two triangular matrices, one upper triangular matrix and one lower triangular matrix, such that the product of these two matrices gives the original matrix. LU decomposition solves linear systems of equations, and can also compute the inverse matrix. 

An LU factorization refers to the factorization of A, with proper row and/or column orderings or permutations, into two factors, a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U, A=LU.
Inputs: 
* A = coefficients of square matrix 
Outputs: 
* L = lower triangular matrix
* U = upper triangular matrix
* P = the permutation matrix

Limitations: If the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns (not square matrix) then LU Decopm cannot be performed.
